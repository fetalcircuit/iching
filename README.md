# iching
A page that uses p5.js to give generative I-Ching readings. New versions will contain I-Ching text from several online translated sources.

Still contains processing sketches that give an iching reading; the algorithm is based upon Lejaren Hiller's I-Ching Oracle subroutine for the ILLIAC II. ("Programming the I-Ching oracle." Computer Studies in the Humanities and Verbal Behavior 3 (1970): 130-43.)
